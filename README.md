# WeirdestSpeciesCombination


### Welcome
In the middle ground between science and superstition we dive into the weird. Here we seek out the weirdest combinations of species on Earth. Come join us as we work through this project. This README file contains an overview and details of the project.

### Project Description
Where is the weirdest combination of species on Earth?

A weird species is one that has very different trait values from others in its community. Weird communities are communities where there's more variation in trait values. 

This preliminary analysis is limited to vascular plants around six Canadian cities.

We use occurrence data from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) and trait data from [TRY](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php).

More details can be found on the [project website](https://github.com/DataDrivenEcologicalSynthesis/WeirdestSpeciesCombination/blob/master/index.html).
