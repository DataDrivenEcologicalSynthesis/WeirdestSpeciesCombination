# Project Roadmap 

## Project Mission and Summary

We're going to determine a) how to define a "weird species combination" and b) where in the world are the weirdest groupings of said combinations.

## Milestones 

1. Figure out a question
2. Get some data
3. Attempt to answer question
4. Present project for other groups on date ?
5. The real project was the friendship we made along the way


## Milestone Tasks

1. Determine our research question
   - [ ] Brainstorm as a group 
   - [ ] Determine question parameters (e.g. what is "weird") 
   - [ ] Set a deadline to reach this milestone
   
   - 20-May-20 meeting:
      - Potential Questions/Approaches
         1. What city in Canada has the weirdest surrounding plant community?
         2. Can we place them along a "Transect of weird"?
         3. Should weirdness be defined as a) a deviation from our expected species composition? b) different from the average in the area? Should we focus only on species identities, or on traits? 
         4. Focus on plant species first, and if the approach work incorporate another taxa (e.g. mammals)
    
   
2. Find the data
   - As per 20-MAY-20 phone meeting:
      - Interested in plant species across Canada
          - likely this data will be from within 100 km of a city  
      - Generate a data set and begin exploring 
         - Combine data from GBIF and TRY databases pairing species occurances with traits
  
   
3. Answer the question
   - [ ] Agree on analyses and work flow
   - [ ] Complete analyses

4. Share with DDES group
