#### Generate Transects for Canadian cities

## Load libraries
library(raster)
library(sf)
# library(dismo) ## used to get Canada Polygon

## load fucntions
source("scripts//functions.r")

## Download polygon for Canada
# canPoly <- getData(name="GADM", country="CAN", level=1) ## run once for download
canPoly <- readRDS("data//gadm36_CAN.rds") ## load polygon
# plot(canPoly) ## takes a while because all the islands


## dataframe of lat, lon for cities
cities <- data.frame(city = c("Vancouver","Edmonton","Winnipeg","Toronto","Montreal","Halifax"),
                     lon = c(-123.1206,-113.4939,-97.1383,-79.3832,-73.5672,-63.575),
                     lat = c(49.2828,53.5461,49.895,43.6532,45.5017,44.6486))


## Create spatial dataframe
coordinates(cities) <- ~lon+lat # specify x and y columns
cities <- st_as_sf(cities) # Proceeded here with the package "sf", I find it more userfriendly than sp. Also the format with all the cities in the same dataframe class=="sf" was easier to play with than the class=="sp".
proj4string(cities) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84") ## Need to use a CRS (I picked WGS84), for non-GIS folk, this does a good job explaining a CRS https://rspatial.org/raster/spatial/6-crs.html

## Notes
## a CRS of WGS84 has units in decimal degrees. The earth is circular so 1 decimal degree does not equal the same thing at different latitudes (e.g. higher latitudes smaller distances, latitudes closer to the equator are larger).
## Every degree away from the equator is equal to cosine of that latitude.
deg2rad <- function(deg) {(deg * pi) / (180)} ## function converts decimal degrees to radians
lat2km <- function(lat){ cos(deg2rad(lat)) * 111.32 } ## cosine of latitude in radius multiplied by the size of the decimal at the equator

## Find out the units of km for decimal degrees at the latitude of Toronto.
lat2km(43.6532) ## 1 decimal degree at Toronto is 80.5435

## Decimal degrees to 10 km buffer
resToronto <- 1/80.5435*10 ## 0.1241 decimal degrees  = 10 km

## List cities to generate transects not in sp dataframe
cities <- data.frame(city = c("Vancouver","Edmonton","Winnipeg","Toronto","Montreal","Halifax"),
                     lon = c(-123.1206,-113.4939,-97.1383,-79.3832,-73.5672,-63.575),
                     lat = c(49.2828,53.5461,49.895,43.6532,45.5017,44.6486))
