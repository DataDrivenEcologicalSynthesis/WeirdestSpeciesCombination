### Welcome
In the middle ground between science and superstition we dive into the weird. Here we seek out the weirdest combinations of species on Earth? Come join us as we work through this project. This readme file contains an overview and details of the project.

### Project Description
Where is the weirdest combination of species on Earth?

### Generate transects
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Load backend code for functions that generate transects
source("scripts//createTransects.r")

## dataframe of lat, lon for cities
cities <- data.frame(city = c("Toronto"),
             lon = c(-79.3832),
             lat = c(43.6532))

## Create transect for Toronto
torontoTransect <- cityTransect(citylon = cities$lon, citylat = cities$lat, nquadrat = 5,  ## nquadrat is the number of quadrats
                                buffer=5, ## distance in km around the centroid of city to make the buffer. e.g. 5 = 10 x 10 km box with city as center
                                distance = 10) ## distance in km between buffered transects

## Plot transect
plot(canPoly[canPoly$NAME_1=="Ontario",], col="orange", ylim=c(41,45), xlim=c(-82,-76)) ## plot just Ontario, set x & y lim to zoom into Toronto area
plot(torontoTransect, add=T, col="blue")
```
